this is NOT a 'proper' synth.. it's the thing i have been experimenting with, while i rebuilt the mip2 framework around clap.. so, this is just as much a test/beta for the framework itself.. it is used for most (if not all) my plugins (and related applications), so the more stable and compatible i can make it, the better..

the symth itself.. it is build using clap 0.25.0, so you need a recent host (currently the newest bitwig beta) to use it.. it is 16-voice polyphonic, quite minimalistic audio capabilities (just enough for testing clap and the framework), but has some interesting features:

* note expressions
* mono, and polyphonic modulation
* host thread-pool for the voices
* sample accurate events
..
